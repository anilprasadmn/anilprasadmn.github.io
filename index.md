## Welcome to my personal home page

I am presently an industrial researcher with `The Inkers technology Private Limited.` At [Inkers](https://theinkers.com) I work in the feild of Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence. My day job involves translating advancments in Deep neural networks in the feild of computer vision to holistic integrated systems that solves vision in a realtime and scalable fashion. 

### my personal outlook towards research

```markdown
Research is useless if its not open-source, open-access, easily reproducable and collaborative. 
```
in that retrospect, I love the feild of AI which has adhered to these standards and love the cultural standards it has set in research.

PS: due to unavoidable constraints, most of my non-published research has not been opensource repositories. 

### About life, fun, work ...

I belive that we are a species that will perish one day. Its inevitable. We will be survived by a new species that we will nurture. We have taken baby steps towards that. In such grand scheme of things, Our lives will have little meaning beyond the ones we find simple pleasures in and what we leave behind. I yearn to see the miracle of such a leap in our existance and can work tirelessly for such an end. If you share such a view about life, please shoot me a mail and we will defenitely click. My mantra will be `Enjoy, Work and nurture.ai.`
